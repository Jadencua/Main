This is the Runtime Terror Signature Management Add-In for Outlook

This add in enables a user to load speciic databases, create, store, insert, insert random, remove a selection, or remove all signatures.

To start, the user should Load Work Signatures or Load Personal Signatures. By taking this step first, this ensures the user can work out of the database selected. 

After a database has been selected, the user can create a signature by providing a signature in the "Enter New Signature" text box. Once the user has entered the full signature they'd like to store, the signature can be stored by selecting "Store Signature". This stores the signature in the the database which they are currently viewing.

The user can then utilize the "Search or Select for an Available Signatures" drop down to find a stored signature. This drop down can be searched both by typing or by manually selecting from the drop down. Once a selection has been made, the user can insert that signature by selecting "Insert Selection".

Beneath the Search or Select drop down, the user can Insert Random, Remove Selection, and Remove All available signatures for the database that is currently being viewed.
